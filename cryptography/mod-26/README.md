# Notes

## Challenge: Mod 26

The below text is given for deciphering:

```
cvpbPGS{arkg_gvzr_V'yy_gel_2_ebhaqf_bs_ebg13_MAZyqFQj}
```

The problem statement says that it uses [ROT13](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROT13) cipher. So I wrote a python script to decipher it. Run get_flag.py to get the flag.

### Command:

```bash
python3 get_flag.py
```

### Output:

```bash
picoCTF{next_time_I'll_try_2_rounds_of_rot13_ZNMldSDw}
```
