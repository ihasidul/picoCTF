While going through the files served by the link i found a file `secure.js`.
This files comes up when it shows Log In Failed page. This js file contains the
password check. 
### secure.js
```
function checkPassword(username, password)
{
  if( username === 'admin' && password === 'strongPassword098765' )
  {
    return true;
  }
  else
  {
    return false;
  }
}

```
Here i found the actual login credentials.
Using these credentials we get the flag.

### Flag
